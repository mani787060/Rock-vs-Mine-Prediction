# Rock vs Mine Prediction (Sonar Dataset)

This project predicts whether an object detected through sonar signals is a **Rock** or a **Mine**.  
It uses a real-world sonar dataset consisting of 60 features extracted from frequency-based reflections.

## Contents
- Loading and exploring the Sonar dataset
- Data preprocessing & StandardScaler
- Train-test splitting
- Model building using Logistic Regression / KNN / SVM / Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Prediction for new sonar sample input

## Key Concepts
- Binary classification workflow
- Scaling high-dimensional data
- Interpreting classification metrics
- Real-world signal detection application

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
